### About this project
This project is a fulfillment for the mini project requirement for one of my MIS subjects - CSMC 207 - Web Programming and Development.

# What to expect?

### Interactive options
`Edit Mode`
```
This option allows you to change few things in this page such as background color, text color, and typography.
```

`Reset` button *(icon beside Edit Mode option)* 
```
Clicking this button will clear the values stored in the `window.localStorage` object which basically resets the page to its default settings.
```

This page utilizes javascript's `window.localStorage` object, which basically saves values *(pre-defined key-value pairs)* in your browser. This means any updates you will make using `Edit Mode` will remain, even when you reload the page, until you click the `Reset` button.
